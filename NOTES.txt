    - cart number when adding to cart
    - cart must be based on what you've added not shorts only
    - payment
    - deleted product column in details
    - PROBLEM: user id, only the user_id 1 can add to cart what the heElLLlL

TO DO:
    - email validation

    - payment
    - orders (to know where is your order)
    - registration

    Make another account, manually change the default user_type to 'admin'.
        - admin update products (need to update whole list/menu)
        - admin orders
        - admin messages (admin_contacts)
    
    - animation
    - pk anf fk in database
